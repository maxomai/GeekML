Geek Markup Language 0.0

The purpose of Geek Markup Language (GeekML, or GML) is to be a Geek Code[1] for the Web 2.0 era. By way of background, Geek Code was invented in the pre-web Internet era as a way for geeks (or nerds, or what have you) to briefly 
describe themselves in a block of barely comprehensible gobeltygook that resembed a PGP public key or public signature. This started as a lark, but became an early Internet phenomenon. Geeks would attach Geek Code Blocks to their emails, append them to .plan files, and so on. 

Unfortunately Geek Code suffers from some flaws. Geeky cultulral phenomena are hard-coded into Geek Code, which makes Geek Code blocks stale as old phenomena end and new phenomena emerge. This is particularly unfortunate since Geek Code, as of this writing (April 2014), hasn't been updated since 1996[2]. 

Geek Markup Language is intended as an update of the Geek Code concept that avoids Geek Code's major shortcoming. GeekML is extensible. Initially it exists as a JSON schema, with an XML schema to follow. Instead of hard-coding phenomena, GeekML describes broad categories of phenomena and allows the geek to describe themselves according to their participation and level of participation in each phenomenon. Eventually I hope this will follow in Geek Code's proud tradition.
